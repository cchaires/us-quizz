# Quizz U.S. States Game

This Python code is a simple game that challenges players to guess the names of U.S. states by clicking on a map of the country. The game is implemented using the Turtle graphics library.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python code.
2. The game window will display a map of the United States with a number of blank states.
3. The program will ask you to guess the name of a state.
4. Type the name of the state in the pop-up window that appears and press Enter.
5. If you guess the state correctly, it will be filled in on the map and you will earn a point.
6. If you guess the state incorrectly, nothing will happen and you will not earn a point.
7. Repeat steps 3-6 until you have correctly guessed all 50 states, or until you type "Exit" to quit the game.
8. When the game ends, the program will display the number of states you guessed correctly and a list of states that you missed.
